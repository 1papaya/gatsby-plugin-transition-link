✔ pass the same transitionState to pages / templates that's passed to the TransitionConsumer @done(18-10-26 10:49)
✔ prevent transitionlinks from being clicked while a transition is in progress @done(18-10-26 15:23)
✔ prevent scroll jumping when transitioning @done(18-10-26 16:04)
✔ BUG: state is reseting before the page transitions from page 2 to page 1. Stopped working in 1c56134dd2dfe3ec3004b97174d34886776b1ac7 @done(18-10-26 18:53)
☐ refactor API
☐ clean up the internal variables and make them all consistent
☐ refactor to make things easier to understand and add comments where necessary
☐ Add <TransitionPortal /> react portal to display content above the page while transitioning
☐ Add layer prop to transitionportal with the possible values of "bottom" "middle" and "above"
✘ Consider an option to separate entry and exit portals @cancelled(18-10-26 10:56) // no need for this. Portals retain their react context so TransitionConsumer can be used in them.
☐ Add some generic default transitions using transition portal
    ☐ fade
    ☐ cover swipe up, left, right, down
    ☐ expanding bubble
    ☐ wipe in
☐ Add example of using triggerTransition() to transition using events other than click
☐ release v1
☐ Write blog post for gatsbyjs.org

Future
☐ hook into location state so that going back and forward in the browser still triggers animation
