✔ BUG: state is reseting before the page transitions from page 2 to page 1. Stopped working in 1c56134dd2dfe3ec3004b97174d34886776b1ac7 @done(18-10-26 18:53)
✔ refactor API @done(18-10-27 12:38)
    ✔ add the ability to delay exit (same as entry. on click the trigger should go but the state shouldn't change until the delay is up, navigation should also be paused. @done(18-10-27 12:15)
    ✔ pass entire enter prop object into enter trigger function (same for exit) @done(18-10-27 12:37)
✔ clean up the internal variables and make them all consistent @done(18-10-27 12:54)
    ✔ for should be length @done(18-10-27 12:54)
    ✔ in should be delay @done(18-10-27 12:54)
☐ add exitdelay to state
☐ add entire exit and entry props to transition state consumer / page props
☐ refactor to make things easier to understand and add comments where necessary
☐ Add <TransitionPortal /> react portal to display content above the page while transitioning
☐ Add layer prop to transitionportal with the possible values of "bottom" "middle" and "above"
✘ Consider an option to separate entry and exit portals @cancelled(18-10-26 10:56) // no need for this. Portals retain their react context so TransitionConsumer can be used in them.
☐ Add some generic default transitions using transition portal
    ☐ fade
    ☐ cover swipe up, left, right, down
    ☐ expanding bubble
    ☐ wipe in
☐ Add example of using triggerTransition() to transition using events other than click
☐ update docs
    ☐ new api
    ☐ add a visual timeline of events in, for, trigger, state, and when they happen
    ☐ idea / overview section should be rewritten and moved to blog post
☐ release v1
☐ Write blog post for gatsbyjs.org

Future
☐ hook into location state so that going back and forward in the browser still triggers animation (this should be optional with a plugin setting "reverse: bool" which can also be overridden by a prop.
